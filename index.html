              <em>The air we breathe is filled with doubt.That's what anyone would say if they treasure each single moment they had the precious moment that oxygen got inside their warm bodies.</em>

              I had  a chance to live such a miserable life.You may wonder what my reason for sharing that with you.Well, this is what I got from that way of doing things.As a child of the world I learnt that early that nature provides for its own.So why would I waste my time doing real work to fulfill my needs? </p>
              <p>
              	I will referene the old adage that was probably put up by an ancestor I share with, due to lack of accurate records, four hundred million people across the world.You have seen  him in history bookes.With his thick mat of hair covering every inch of his body.Plus that piece of carrot that he never seems to ever put to his mouth.Well atleast he was clever atleast to know that he needed fire, sharp tools etc. Well had it not being for his raw resilience we probably would be in caves having stock of carrots and roots to guide us through the winter.That is if he even bothered to find a good mate that ensured survival of the species.Coming to think of it, I do not think they had the standards we have today.
              	I think beauty was how much rock you could lift for your man to stash his roots, well because caves did not have doors.I know that never crossed you mind with all our escalators and social communities we tend to get that anaethestic of reality.
